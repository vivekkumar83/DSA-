# Algorithms:
* combination of unambigious instruction 
* take finite steps to solve a problem in finite amount of time
* output --> must be
* input ---> not compulsoury
* we will not design any algorithm but we will study and analyse the different design for solving the problem
* brute force --> simple path to solve a problem
* Gready --> take what you get now
* Dynamic programing --> check every possibility
* Divide & Conqure --> divide, conqure & combine problem
* Backtracking
* Branch & Bound
## Analysis of the code:
* time complexity
* space complexity

### Time Complexity of a Code:
* Amount of time taken by the algorithm to run as a function of the input size
* O(1)--> Constant no loop
* O(logn) --> logrithmic
* O(n)---> linear
* O(nlogn) ----> log linear
* O(n^2) ----> Quadratic 
* O(2^n) ----> exponential
* O(n!) -----> factorial

* how many times a statement is executed by the CPU is known as the order of magnitude
